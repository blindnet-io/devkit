## About

The blindnet devkit enables secured collection and automated management of sensitive data while helping to develop trustworthy applications via premade privacy-management user interfaces.

It is made of several independent, yet cohesive Open Source libraries, services and tools.
Developing such components involves different technologies and approaches, and is therefore better conducting using different repositories.

This repository is only here to ease usage and contribution to the blindnet DevKit as a whole.
